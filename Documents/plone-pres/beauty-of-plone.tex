\section{What is a CMS}

\subsection{History}
\slide{In the beginning there was HTML}

% a slide with a picture i drew with html files

% say that they were many, repetitive, hard to maintain
% Show different things to each user: dynamic pages
%
% users

\slide{Then there were scripts}

% a slide with a picture of php asp and html
%
% how nice things were
% scripts were many, only technical people could manage, again
% repetitive among developers
